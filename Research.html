    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>I do research to gain insights about national brand-store brand competition (my thesis topic), private label marketing, price-advertising strategies, and brand equity. I use empirical, economic, econometric, and meta-analytic models to address these topics. Thus  I can be labeled as an empirically-oriented, managerially-motivated researcher.
    </P>
    <P>
        I have published 42 research articles as of Jan. 2024 (Google citations = 6091; h-index = 30). These articles are listed below in descending order of year of publication – from newest to oldest. You can access the articles for personal use by clicking on the title. I am working on eleven research projects, also listed below.
